Ford Car Price Prediction 🚗

The project is conceptualized from the perspective of analyzing a Ford car dataset to determine the impact of various car attributes on the final selling price. The process involves data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to determine patterns, trends, and correlations between various attributes such as car model year, mileage, engine capacity, fuel type, and transmission. Once the dataset is prepared, machine learning algorithms are used to develop predictive models that can predict car prices with high accuracy. The project not only aims at developing a predictive model but also emphasizes the key factors that affect car prices, which can be an important area of insight for car buyers, sellers, and analysts.

The major points of the project are:

-> Missing value handling and raw data preprocessing

-> Exploratory data analysis to determine trends and correlations

-> Categorical feature encoding and numerical data scaling

-> Machine learning model development and evaluation for car price prediction

-> Result interpretation to identify key factors that influence car prices

In summary, this project showcases the application of Python, Pandas, NumPy, data visualization libraries, and Scikit-learn for solving a real-world regression problem and illustrates the complete data science process from raw data to valuable predictions.
